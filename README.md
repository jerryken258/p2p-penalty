# P2P Penalty Resolution System

A decentralized, blockchain-powered platform for fair and transparent penalty and dispute management built on the Stacks blockchain.

## Overview

P2P Penalty eliminates traditional intermediary barriers by providing a secure, trustless mechanism for handling penalties, compensation, and dispute resolution. The platform enables:

- Parties to create binding penalty agreements
- Secure escrow of penalty funds
- Transparent dispute resolution process
- Neutral mediation for complex scenarios
- Flexible resolution mechanisms
